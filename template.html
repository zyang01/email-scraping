  <title>Fwd: Get supporters for: “Find the knowledge of good and
    evil. What crime against humanity did I commit?”</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
  <p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
  <p>Please find below my petition to the UK Parliament concerning the
    knowledge of good and evil.</p>
  <p>You can find out how it all started with a lie <a href="https://hesaidlove.com/posts/on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://hesaidlove.com/posts/on-paranoia-and-delusion/" target="_blank">this post</a>, you can read about the consequences of not knowing how to spell good and evil.
  </p>
  <p>I devised a method to distinguish the sheep and goats in your life, and you can take the <a href="https://hesaidlove.com/posts/on-sheep-and-goats/" target="_blank">sheep or goat self-test</a> to find out about some good news and more.</p>
  <p>Please also see <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">my warning letter</a> concerning the imminent danger of Artificial Intelligence and analysis of the resulting hyperinflation.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, <a href="https://hesaidlove.com/posts/on-we-all-die/" target="_blank">some humble opinions</a> on the terminal illness of nihilism.</p>
  <p>For Love and Devotion,</p>
  <p>Jonah T. Yang<br>

            <p>Dear Jonah Troublemaker Yang,</p>
            <p>You’re not done yet!</p>
            <p>Five people need to sign your petition for us to check
              it.</p>
            <p>Share <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/714724/sponsors/new?token=sVp9ZnfBuCPfLbij1bxC"
                moz-do-not-send="true">your petition</a> with your
              potential supporters, or send them the information at
              the bottom of this email.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve gained five signatures, we’ll check your
              petition to make sure it meets the <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/help#standards"
                moz-do-not-send="true">petition standards</a>. If it

              periods, this may take longer. Thank you for your
              patience.</p>
            <p>Up to 20 people can sign your petition while we are
              checking it. Please wait until it’s been checked and

            <p>Find the knowledge of good and evil. What crime against
              humanity did I commit?</p>
            <p>Long story short, I'm 28 and my income was mid-six
              figures last April. I was effectively a single parent
              since COVID and paid for my two adult younger siblings'
              private and higher education in London. I nearly threw
              myself off the balcony on the fifth-floor in front of my
              sister back in August.</p>
            <p>I declared bankruptcy three months ago and started
              writing down my story on my blog, HeSaid.Love
              (HeSaidLove.com) and I have written 245 posts on topics
              including but not limited to mathematics, physics,
              computer science, psychology, economics, philosophy,
              performing arts and theology. I was in Jerusalem last
              week, and I wanted to speak to a rabbi regarding the
              Book of Isaiah, but I ended up crying alone on Mount
              Zion. I would like to know if anyone still knows how to
              spell good and evil.</p>
